  <description>
    A solid metal chamber made out of Dnaium to keep the resource from leaking out. It's not
    comfortable but then again neither will the procedure be.\n\n
    This is where the base of performing a sinful act of altering the DNA happens, God looks
    down on you as you alter his imperfect creation but then again why is he letting you do it?
