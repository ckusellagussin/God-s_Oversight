  <label>Dnaide Sickness</label>
  <labelNoun>Sickness from having a Dnaium transfusion</labelNoun>
  <description>This pawn has been in the Creation Chamber, whether you had an operation or not...This pawn will
  be in a coma for a few days. Being in the chamber means the pawn has inhaled dnaium particles (no matter how many) in a very close
  proximity and Dnaium is still a bit potent to a pawn but not as much as injesting or a full Dnide gas out.
