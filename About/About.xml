  <description>This mod is God's Oversight, the mistake created by the allmighty and didn't purge when he let
    [insert mutant source here] crash on the rimworlds. The rimworlds are now blessed or corrupted depending on
    how you feel. The thing is...could you use this to your advantage in surviving or use it for domination?
    \n\nFor Version 1.2
