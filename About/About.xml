  <description>This mod is God's Oversight, the mistake created by the allmighty and didn't purge when they let Dnaium crash on to the rimworlds. The rimworlds are now blessed or corrupted depending on how you feel. The thing is...could you use this to your advantage in surviving or use it for domination?
    \nFor Version 1.3
